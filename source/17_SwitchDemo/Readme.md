# Overview

This project
is a small prototype app that reviews how AvalonEdit will cope if we use **2 different Document** bindings
and switch between them whenever we like to. I needed this feature because I wanted to kind of overlay
2 different displays when showing highlighting for different lines (comparing) or editing the text
when a user would wish to re-align different sections of text in [Ã„hnlich](https://github.com/Dirkster99/Aehnlich).
