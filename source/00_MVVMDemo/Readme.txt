Overview
--------

This project shows how text editing with syntax highlighting can be integrated into an MVVM/WPF
application. The demo application supports:

1) Loading text files
2) Editing (copy/paste/cut)
3) Changing highlighting definitions

SAVING edited text is not supported in this version of the demo application. This demo application
is just a base starting point for other more complicated developments that involve theming with WPF,
themeable highlighting, and other extensions, such as, zooming text size during editing.
